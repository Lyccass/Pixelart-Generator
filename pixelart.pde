/*

export in x2 ,x2, x3 and x4 
save json needs to be fixed, i guess the loading of more layer than initated can be a problem as well as i cant save colors :(
copy paste for hex code check bc not working:( strg+v doesnt work

colour picker maybe on image as well
simpler access to eraser
maybe swap between fill and draw

toggle eraser seperatly
increase draw and eraser radius with mousewheel?

better ui
undo and redo are not working as expected


MAYBE ACTUAL animations?
